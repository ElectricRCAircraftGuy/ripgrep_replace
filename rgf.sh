# RipGrep Fuzzyfinder (rgf)
# This is a simple script that turns RipGrep (`rg`) into a simple interactive fuzzy finder to find
# content in any files.
# See: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#3-interactive-ripgrep-integration

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Install RipGrep: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation
# 2. Install `fzf` fuzzy finder: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation
#    The "Using git" instructions there, for instance, work great.
# 3. Create a symlink in ~/bin to this script so you can run it from anywhere.
#       cd /path/to/here
#       mkdir -p ~/bin
#       ln -si "${PWD}/rgf.sh" ~/bin/rgf     # required
#       ln -si "${PWD}/rgf.sh" ~/bin/gs_rgf  # optional; replace "gs" with your initials
# 4. Now you can use this command directly anywhere you like in any of these ways:
#   1. `rgf`
#   2. `gs_rgf`

HELP_STR="\
This ('$EXECUTABLE_NAME') is a RipGrep interactive fuzzy finder of content in files!

It is a simple wrapper script around Ripgrep and the fzf fuzzy finder that turns RipGrep ('rg') into
an easy-to-use interactive fuzzy finder to find content in any files. Options passed to this
program are passed to 'rg'.

The default behavior of Ripgrep used under-the-hood here is '--smart-case', which means:
    Searches case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase. Search case sensitively otherwise.

EXAMPLE USAGES:

1. Pass in '-i' to make Ripgrep act in case 'i'nsensitive mode:
        rgf -i
2. You can specify a path to search in as well:
        rgf \"path/to/some/dir/to/search/in\"
3. Providing an initial search regular expression is allowed, but only optional:
        rgf \"my regular expression search pattern\"
4. If you do both a regex pattern and a path, follow the order Ripgrep requires:
        rgf \"regex pattern\" \"path\"
5. Search only in \"*.cpp\" files!
        rgf -g \"*.cpp\"
6. Also search hidden files (files that begin with a dot ('.') in Unix or Linux)
        rgf --hidden

- See also my 'sublf' and 'fsubl' aliases in .bash_aliases.
- Run 'rg -h' or 'man rg' if you wish to see the RipGrep help menu.
- Run 'fzf -h' or 'man fzf' if you wish to see the fzf fuzzy finder help menu.
